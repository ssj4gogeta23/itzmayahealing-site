            Many people carry stress and energetic residue from work, relationships, environments, and life experiences that never fully had space to settle.
            Over time, the body stays alert. The nervous system doesn’t shut off. Even when things look fine on the outside, something inside feels unsettled.
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Rest that doesn’t fully restore you</li>
            <li>Feeling tense, jumpy, or on edge</li>
            <li>Emotional weight that doesn’t match the moment</li>
            <li>Feeling disconnected from yourself or your direction</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="small">
            This isn’t a failure of willpower. It’s a sign your system needs space to reset.

              My name is Miguel. My work is shaped by lived experience, discipline, and years of personal practice — not trends or spiritual performance.
            </p>
            <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;">
              I don’t rush people into conclusions or tell them what they <em>should</em> be experiencing. I pay attention to what’s actually happening in the body,
              the nervous system, and the subtle signals people often learn to ignore just to keep going.
            </p>
            <p class="small">
              I work quietly and deliberately. Sessions are not about forcing change or chasing intensity. They’re about creating enough safety for the system to settle,
              so what needs to release can do so naturally.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2>What sessions support</h2>
            <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;">
              Reiki is one of the tools I use — but the heart of the work is presence, grounding, and restoration.
            </p>
            <ul class="checklist">
              <li>Feeling back in your body</li>
              <li>Regaining inner steadiness</li>
              <li>Letting accumulated stress unwind</li>
              <li>Reconnecting with your awareness and direction</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small">
              Healing doesn’t need to be dramatic to be real. It needs to be steady, respectful, and honest.

            People rarely arrive with a clear label. They arrive because something in their system is asking for attention.

            Some are moving through demanding environments. Some are recovering from prolonged stress or emotional overload.
            Some are sensitive to their surroundings and absorb more than they realize.
            What they have in common is a nervous system that hasn’t had space to fully settle.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            You don’t need to know exactly what’s wrong to begin. You only need to notice that something wants care.

            <h2>How sessions work</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              A blend of presence, body awareness, and subtle work.
            </p>
            <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;">
              We begin with a brief check‑in. You don’t need to prepare anything or explain your entire life story.
              What matters is what you’re noticing <em>now</em> — physically, emotionally, or energetically.
            </p>
            <p class="small">
              From there, the session unfolds without pressure. Some people feel sensations in the body. Some feel a deep sense of calm or mental quiet.
              Others don’t notice much during the session itself but recognize changes afterward — better sleep, less reactivity, clearer thinking, or a subtle sense of relief.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h2>After the session</h2>
            <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;">
              There’s no pressure to interpret or analyze what happened. Afterward, I may suggest simple grounding or awareness practices — nothing complicated,
              nothing overwhelming — just support for integration.
            </p>
            <ul class="checklist">
              <li>Some people come once</li>
              <li>Some return periodically</li>
              <li>Some work in phases</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small">
              There’s no required path or commitment. This work is meant to support your life, not become another obligation.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="banner" style="margin-top:18px;">
          <div>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom:6px;">Begin where you are.</h2>

          This work is not a replacement for medical or mental health care. If you’re dealing with physical symptoms, pain, or mental health concerns,
          professional support is essential. Energy work is a complementary practice focused on regulation, clarity, and balance.
